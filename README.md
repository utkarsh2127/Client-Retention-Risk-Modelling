# Client Retention and Risk Modelling

## 🎯 Overview
The Client Retention and Risk Modelling project is designed to predict client churn and assess potential risk factors. Using a combination of data preprocessing, machine learning, and explainability techniques, it provides actionable insights for business decision-making.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - CatBoost
- ⚙️ **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Improve model performance using `Optuna`.
- 🧠 **Model Explainability**: Leverage `SHAP` to interpret predictions.
- 📈 **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assess models with metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and classification reports.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Python: Core programming language
- pandas: Data manipulation
- numpy: Numerical operations
- matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
- scikit-learn: Preprocessing and modeling
- xgboost, lightgbm, catboost: Advanced machine learning models
- shap: Model explainability
- optuna: Hyperparameter tuning

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, encode, and scale data for analysis.
2. **Model Training**: Build and optimize machine learning models to predict retention and risk.
3. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
4. **Explainability**: Interpret predictions using SHAP to uncover key features influencing decisions.
